This is a temporary website for the Software Systems Student Society. Feel free to look around the code. In it, you'll find one HTML file that was written by [@shovon](https://github.com/shovon), as well as some custom CSS. Most of all you'll find some more CSS, which come from the [1140 CSS Grid](http://cssgrid.net/) framework to give the site "responsive-ness" that's all the craze these days.
